# 4. Linux
Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance, then redistribute. 

Linux is an open source OS. 

Some Linux principles:
- Everything is a file, including hardware
- Small single purpose programs, which can be chained together for complex operations
- Avoid captive user interface
- Configuration data stored in text file

Why Linux: 
- open source
- community support
- support wide variety of hardware
- allows for customization
- most servers runs on Linux
- automation is easy
- good security

Linux architecture: Hardware -> kernel -> shell -> apps, tools, ...
