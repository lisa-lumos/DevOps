# Introduction to DevOps
In DevOps, it is not just about learning technologies and tools, it's also about integrating them together. 

For a long time, IT industry is divided into two zones: `development` (developers, testers, build and release) and `operations` (Delivering the software and its features to the end users, like system administrators, cloud engineers). Over the period of time, because of Agile and other methodologies, `development has become very fast, but the operation is still slow`. So the software and its feature are not getting delivered as fast as it's getting developed. `DevOps solves this problem of delivery`. Whenever you have code and end user, you need DevOps.
